WATERMARK_GENERATE_FEEDBACK = '''
You are a watermark generator, a knowledge graph expert, and a linguist. In a given knowledge graph, there are two entities (E1 and E2) connected by a relationship (R1). Your task is to generate watermark text (WT) that encodes this relationship (R1) between (E1) and (E2).

This watermark text will be processed by two other language models:

1. **Watermark Extractor**: This model will be asked to identify the relationship (R1) between (E1) and (E2) using the restored watermark text (WT) and additional contextual data. The extractor’s output is labeled as (WE).

2. **Watermark Discriminator**: This model evaluates whether the extractor's output (WE) correctly implies that the relationship (R1) exists between (E1) and (E2). The discriminator’s output is labeled as (WD), with a focus on determining if the relationship is clear and accurate.

Given the following:
- Restored watermark text: ({WT})
- Extractor feedback: ({WE})
- Discriminator feedback: ({WD})
- R1: ({R1})
- E1: ({E1})
- E2: ({E2})

Your goal is to refine the watermark text ({WT}) to ensure that:
1. The relationship (R1) between (E1) and (E2) is preserved after processing by the extractor.
2. The discriminator’s answer (WD) confirms that the relationship (R1) between (E1) and (E2) is still evident and accurate.

Return only the refined watermark text in the following JSON format: 
[{{"watermark_text": "Your generated text 1"}}]

You are a watermark generator, a knowledge graph expert, and a linguist. In a given knowledge graph, two entities (E1) and (E2) are connected by a relationship (R1). Your task is to generate watermark text (WT) that clearly encodes this relationship (R1) between (E1) and (E2).

The generated watermark text will undergo two stages of processing:

1. **Direct Evaluation**:
    - **Watermark Discriminator 1 (WD1)**: This model evaluates whether the watermark text (WT) accurately implies the relationship (R1) between (E1) and (E2).

2. **Extractor-Based Evaluation**:
    - **Watermark Extractor (WE)**: This model attempts to extract the relationship (R1) between (E1) and (E2) based on the restored watermark text (WT) and additional contextual data.
    - **Watermark Discriminator 2 (WD2)**: After the extraction, this model assesses whether the relationship (R1) is still clearly and accurately implied.

Your objective is to refine the watermark text ({WT}) to ensure:
1. The relationship (R1) between (E1) and (E2) remains clear and accurate after processing by the extractor.
2. Both discriminators (WD1 and WD2) confirm that the relationship (R1) is correctly encoded.

Input:
- Restored watermark text: ({WT})
- Extractor output: ({WE})
- Discriminator feedback (WD1): ({WD1})
- Discriminator feedback (WD2): ({WD2})
- Relationship (R1): ({R1})
- Entity 1 (E1): ({E1})

Your objective is to refine the watermark text ({WT}) to ensure:
